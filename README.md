# Face-recognition-openface

## How to start ?
1) Put photos of peoples you want to recognize in DIFFERENT directory in your dataset directory (use their names as directory name)
  1.2) if the dataset is not at the root of the project, go to conf/conf.py and modify the DATASET_PATH variable
2) Run build.py
3) Run recognize_video.py (if you have a webcam, obviously...) or recognize.py --image path/to/image

That's it !
